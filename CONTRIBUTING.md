## Getting started

You can contribute to the wmbusmeters-ha-addon content and site in several ways.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters/labels/ha-addon). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ha-addon&template=ha-addon-request.yml). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters/labels/ha-addon) to find one that interests you. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
3. Changes should be made only on wmbusmeters-ha-addon-edge directory that represents edge channel. Those changes will be merged in stable channel automatically.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to make tests if possible:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Comment PR as detailed as possible so we can understand what is the scope of PR. 
- Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a wmbusmeters team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI or you can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

### Your PR is merged!
